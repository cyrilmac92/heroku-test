Learning how to use heroku.

I crated a sample spring boot application to be deployed to heroku.
The purpose of this application is for anybody to get a sample webservice that they can just clone and deploy into
heroku within a couple of minutes.

Pull requests for any modification to make this more generic is welcomed.
